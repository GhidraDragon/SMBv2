So for public repos, we let ChatGPT "red team" and Github to remove if Github deems against their ToS, or if ChatGPT's safety token generator somehow catches generation from your prompt; for manually verified exploits (yes ChatGPT can make mistakes; verify truth before assuming so, dumbass; this is the essence of being alive) then move to private repo..
